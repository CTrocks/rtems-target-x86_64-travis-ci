# Travis Configuration for RTEMS Toolchain - Target: x86_64

This is the travis configuration file repository for automated build jobs of RTEMS toolchain for target x86_64 using Travis CI.

NOTE: This currently doesn't work with the public and free offer of Travis CI as the toolchain build requires download of tarballs (GCC components).

I'll update the repo once I got a workaround for this issue. Nevertheless, the configuration file could be used and started and first failed on the download which is triggered by RTEMS Source Builder. So the provided configuration should not be totally wrong^^..
